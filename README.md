# Cloud Computing CI/CD Project

This project showcases the successful setup and deployment of an application on AWS EC2 with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). It also demonstrates the integration of additional AWS services to enhance the functionality of the application.

## Steps for Setup and Deployment

I've completed the following steps to create an AWS EC2 instance and deploy an application using CI/CD:

1. **Research AWS**:
   - I thoroughly researched AWS, understanding its offerings and services to make informed decisions.

2. **EC2 Instance Setup**:
   - I created an EC2 instance on AWS via the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensured the EC2 instance was publicly accessible over the internet.

3. **SSH Access**:
   - I set up SSH access from my local PC to the EC2 instance.
   - Properly managed credentials and SSH keys to establish secure connections.

4. **Application Deployment**:
   - I successfully deployed a web application on the EC2 instance. The application was built using Spring Boot for robust performance.

5. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - As part of the project requirements, I integrated an additional AWS service, specifically the AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) to enhance the application's data storage capabilities.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub Actions. This pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring that updates to the application are deployed seamlessly.

7. **Application URL**:
   - The application is accessible via the following URL: [Project Link](https://github.com/ishanksharmaa/TSF-Task4)

   - The URL allows public access to the web application hosted on the EC2 instance.

8. **Video Demonstration**:
   - In the video demonstration, I showcased the entire setup, deployment, and functionality of the application on AWS. The video captures the successful execution of the project, demonstrating my ability to run applications on the cloud effectively.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the power of cloud computing, especially when coupled with CI/CD practices. Leveraging AWS services, I've successfully created and deployed an application that is both accessible over the internet and integrated with a managed database service.

I'm excited to submit this project, which reflects the skills and knowledge I've gained in cloud computing, DevOps, and AWS. It underlines the importance of automation, scalability, and reliable cloud-hosted applications.

Thank you for considering my submission!
